__Filesystem Simulator in C__
- This code simulates a file system in a computer through the command line.
- Implemented in this code is a library called filesys.h created by me. The library allows uses a control struct to control the data flow and what function is implemented based on if a control is true or false. Commands are processed using their ASCII hex value.
